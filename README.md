# Reflection 
## Brief 
Project 2 is to use our CSS skills to create a simple experimental responsive website using a front-end framework. Students will generate the project using an essential starting point provided by ChatGPT and choose their topic. The focus is on code and design rather than content. A reflection on the production process, understanding, and approach to the assignment is also required. 
I have created a website using the chatGPT program and adjusted a few details within the code. Since we could pick anything we wanted to make, I decided to create a Studio Ghibli colour palette website of different movies and colour schemes. 

## ChatGPT
### I told chatGPT to create a code bootstrap website html and css
I just placed the terms of code, bootstrap, website, HTML and CSS to see what chatbot would develop. Ideally, I wanted to start it off as an essential website and layout and then add other elements to the website.

### I told chatGPT to create a image slideshow using bootstrap html and css
This code I wanted to include an image slideshow at the top of the website, but it created a code where it was manually pressing buttons for the next or previous image. I asked it to generate it into an automatic slide show instead, and it was easily made.

 ### I told chatGPT to create grid colour palette 
  I visually didn't know how I wanted the layout to be; I played around with having the colours go across the page, and it didn't fit with it. So I decided to go with grid colour palettes. But I played around with it and added a hover text effect to display the hex code.

 ## Reflection 
Generating this project using ChatGPT has made it easy to code a simple experimental responsive website. Personally, this is my first using ChatGPT, especially having assistance in creating a website. At the beginning of this assessment, I needed to figure out how it functioned and play around with it to see what the outcome coding would look like. From trialling the AI chatbot, I have noticed it is limited to a word count. When I asked to generate a more extended code, it would stop mid-way, leaving an unfinished code. To overcome this problem, I would ask it to continue and finish it, but it wouldn't proceed with the previous code.

Moreover, I have also noticed that when asked to generate an animation using HTML and CSS, it'll get images from the web. However, pictures were unavailable and showed a black block stating the photo was unavailable. So, for example, I asked it to develop an animation sky; images of clouds were unavailable. 

Overall the outcome of the final website could have been more advanced in design and layout. For example, I randomly made a website by asking the AI bot to create certain sections of one page. Instead of adding different items to the page, I should have designed a low-fidelity to visualise what I wanted it to be. 

Furthermore, ChatGPT is suitable for a starting point and enhancing websites by simply asking the bot what you want to develop within codes. Of course, there are some issues with its understanding, but it is helpful in either improving or providing feedback if there is a problem in your code.
