# Reflection 
## Brief 
Project 2 is to use our CSS skills to create a simple experimental responsive website using a front-end framework. Students will generate the project using a basic starting point provided by ChatGPT and choose their own topic. The focus is on code and design, not content. A reflection on the production process, understanding, and approach to the assignment is also required. 
I have created a website simply using the chatGPT program and have adjusted a few details within the code.
